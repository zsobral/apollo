title: Welcome to the Apollo Docs

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ We're excited you're here to learn about Apollo.

The Apollo platform is a complete, GraphQL-based solution for managing the transmission of data between application clients (such as React and iOS apps) and back-end services.

It's easy to adopt Apollo incrementally, meaning you can set it up alongside an existing solution (such as a REST API) and migrate functionality at your convenience.

**The Apollo platform consists of:**

- **Apollo Client**, an <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client" target="_blank">open-source library</a> for transmitting GraphQL operations from an application client to a back-end server

- **Apollo Server**, an <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server" target="_blank">open-source library</a> for receiving, executing, and responding to GraphQL operations from application clients

- **Apollo Graph Manager**, a <a href="https://engine.apollographql.com" target="_blank">cloud service</a> that helps you manage, validate, and secure your organization's entire data graph

Conveniently, we have a tutorial that introduces you to all of these components. Ready to dive in?
